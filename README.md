# üçé CadregraScript - IN DEVELOPMENT!

A totally useless **pseudo** programming language made **just for fun**

![L'inganno della cadrega](/docs/cadrega.gif)

# Motivation

There's not a valid motivation. I just wanted to do something stupid and waste my free time because I can't sleep.

The entire language is in the **maccheroni idioma** (sorry people), so only italians will be able to understand (maybe) what's going on. Sorry again.

# Status

Work in progress.
